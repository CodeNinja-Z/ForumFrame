1. Allowing creating multiple subjects with multiple replies, each reply could take multiple sub-replies as well. In the end, the whole forum system becomes a tree-structure with each subject being the root node.
2. Developed UI using HTML and CSS, embedded JavaScript. Built server with Node.JS, stored data into MySQL database. All common interactions have been accomplished such as adding new topic/reply, deleting, modifying and voting. Replies with higher votes would go up.
3. Designed by REST architecture, supporting RESTful APIs. Program can be further developed by others.
4. Used techniques like JQuery, AJAX on client side, all the replies under certain subject will show up separately without refreshing the whole page. Utilizing sorting algorithm on server side, deciding which reply is going up.
